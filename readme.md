What is Medusa
Medusa is an ecommerce platform with a built-in framework for customization that allows you to build custom commerce applications without reinventing core commerce logic. The framework and modules can be used to build advanced B2B or DTC ecommerce stores, marketplaces, PoS systems, service businesses, or any product that needs foundational commerce primitives. All commerce modules are open-source and freely available on npm.

Learn more about Medusaâ€™s architecture and commerce modules in the Docs.
